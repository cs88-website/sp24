## Early On

* Add digit mod math example.
* keep emphasizing print vs return

## Intro / HOFs Flows Poorly

* Intro:
  * Expressions
  * Then Names / Variables
  * Then Function Calls (borrow Data 8)
* HOFs:
  * Functions as arguments
  * map/filter/reduce
  * Functions as return values
  * Environments

## Recursion Flow:
* 1 lectures on Linear Recursion
* 2 lectures on Tree Recursion
  * Introduce Tree recursive data structures
  * Family tree as a list of lists
  * Directory traversal?
  * Paths as a list of lists?
